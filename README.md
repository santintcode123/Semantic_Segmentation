# Semantic_Segmentation
This repository contains the project of semantic segmentation which we had done so far.
we have uploaded all the models which we explored and trained for the Real time semantic segmentation.
after comparing the result of all architectures we chose one which is most efficient compared to other architecture,we put this architecture in 'our final architecture' folder.




all the folder contains python code of their respective model and model.h5,we just included only final architecure in tflite format since it's our delivered model for semantic segmentation.

'edgemap detection and compressing' contains python code for data preprocessing and converting image into numpy array.
